### What

You can access and send prompts via the api and get an image back within about 5 minutes.

### Tech

Queue: Redis

API: Python-Flask

Web: basic html & php for the gallery display

### Images

The images are 256x256px due to the constraints on only having 8GB gpu available. If we had 16GB we would be able to do 512x512.

### Examples

Prompt "time reversal"
